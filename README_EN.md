# üöÄ Setup and Deployment
### Note: 
To use our chatbot, you must create a **.env** file with your API keys as shown below (for each deployment method, please refer to the specific instructions to know where to create the .env file):  
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
```
## Method 1: Install and Run the Python Application directly
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
    Python >= 3.8.x
    pip >= 24.0
### 1. Clone repository
### 2. Install necessary libraries  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you have to create a **.env** in the root directory named **UITeduQ-MCQs-Generator** (Refer to the **üöÄ Setup and Deployment** section for the content of the .env file)  
### 3. Run the Python server
  - If you want to use the chatbot with data stored on Pinecone (raw-data), refer to the **README_EN.md** file for the instructions in the pinecone_integration/raw_data directory.

## Method 2: Deploy the Application with Docker üê≥
Run commands entirely using Command Prompt  
### 1. Install Docker  
### 2. Pull image to your computer  
Note that this image is only for using the chatbot with raw data stored on Pinecone:
```bash
docker pull lananh15/uiteduq-mcqs-generator:v1
```
After pulling the image, check with the command `docker images` to see the image as shown in the picture below:

### 3. Run the container  
You need to create a **.env** file in the current directory in Command Prompt (refer to the note of **üöÄ Setup and Deployment** section for the content of the .env file), and then start the container:  
```bash
docker run --name uiteduq-mcqs-generator-v1 -dp 5000:5000 --env-file .env lananh15/uiteduq-mcqs-generator:v1
```
Check if the container is running with `docker ps -a`. If you see like the image as shown below, it means it is working:
